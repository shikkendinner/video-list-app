# Video List App
This application is a single page AngularJS application that utilizes a Node.js server to retrieve the RSS feed of [Microsoft's Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) website. It then parses the feed to retrieve all videos with their title, description, and tags (if any).

  2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which should also install npm
  3. Go to the project directory and run `npm install`
  4. Finally, run `npm start` and that should start the server at http://localhost:3000/

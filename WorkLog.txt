June 29th Thursday:
Set up all the files that I would need. A nodeJs server was also set up in order to access the RSS feed in an attempt to bypass CORS and SOP. Set up all the data structures I would need (2 of them) and set up the search bar which will have more functionality later on.

June 30th Friday:
Wrote the code to parse all the data from the RSS feed and store it within the two databases (videoDB and tagDB)

July 1st Saturday:
Basic presentation of all videos with just their title, description, link, and tags
